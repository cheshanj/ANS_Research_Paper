# Vulnerabilities in the process of offloading mobile app data to the cloud and use of blockchain to mitigate vulnerabilities

#### Abstractâ€” The app's processing power, storage, memory, and speed are significant concerns in the current app development process for Android and iOS or any other operating system. In the present day, mobile devices focus on multi-tasking and cannot focus on one application to finish their tasks. Also, these mobile devices cannot allow one application to run solo in the mobile device. As a solution for this issue, researchers and developers establish a subcategory of cloud computing called mobile cloud computing, also known as MCC. the primary purpose of this MCC is to get the burden of processing power, storage, ram to the cloud services. So the Mobile device only needs to store or process critical parts in it. This method is primarily increasing the productivity of any application. However, the solution of MCC is coming with several issues as well. Such as platform diversity, privacy and security concerns of the application, continuous connectivity, and the service's cost. This research paper mainly focuses on the privacy and security concerns and mitigations effective mitigation methods for identified problems. Moreover, to explore how a blockchain module uses to mitigate most concerning security areas of the MCC data offloading.
#### The significant vulnerabilities that need to look in MCC are data privacy and access controls. This paper has proposed a system with blockchain integration as described above. With that integration, users can secure their offloading data from malicious access and data thefts also.
